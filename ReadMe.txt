PROJECT 1: AIRBRUSH
Date: 22 Sep 2021

This project is a simple application with a few different types of airbrushes, geometric drawing tools, and has the capability to load and save the images you alter.

Known Bugs:
Nyan Brush uses drawImage instead of putImageData; after it's used, no other brush can be used.
